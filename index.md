## Welcome to My Personal Webpage!

# Introduction
I am a PhD student at the department of [Mathematics](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MA) of [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in). Recently, I have submitted my doctoral thesis under the supervison of [Prof. Ratna Dutta](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~ratna/). My doctoral thesis presents provably secure advanced cryptographic primitives such as witness encryption, fully homomorphic encryption and functional encryption. I am a member of the [IIT KGP MATH-CRYPTO](https://www.kgpmathcrypto.com). 

I am currently a research intern at the [Cryptography and Information Security (CIS) Laboratories](https://ntt-research.com/cis/) at [NTT Research](https://ntt-research.com). During this internship I am working with Pratish in the area of functional encryption. I am planning to continue my postdoctoral research at NTT Japan.
